4. ANSWER TO IMPORTANT QUESTION...
	
	It is not possible to request data from a different origin (like http://messagehub.heroduapp.com/"), as the same origin policy prevents us from doing this.  Implimented to allow users to visit untrusted websites, this policy prevents our computers from getting malicious files from a different origin, allowing the files access to private data. For making requests from my local machine, this is also not allowed because if web browsers were allowed to access files on your system, they could easily look at people's files and steal their information. Both of these measures were implimented in the hope of security for web browsing.
